Given an array of integers. It is necessary to implement a method that returns array indices,
the values of which add up to the number transferred to the array.

The array is assumed to contain only unique numbers and always has the numbers you are looking for.
The same element cannot be used twice.

array = [3, 8, 15, 17], Number = 23
result = [1,2]

Those. indices 1 and 2 (value 8 and 15) add up to the desired number 23
